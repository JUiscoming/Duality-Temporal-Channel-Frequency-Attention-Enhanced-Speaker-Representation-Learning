# Duality-Temporal-Channel-Frequency-Attention-Enhanced-Speaker-Representation-Learning
Non-official implementation of Duality Temporal Channel Frequency Attention Enhanced Speaker Representation Learning arXiv https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06565

I used this model at hackathon (speaker verification). If you want to use this code, you need to modify some part of code.

- label_extraction at data_loader.py
- enroll_query_label_triplet_extraction at utils.py
